# KhipuAnalysis 

This is a project that I pursued as part of an optional project for a class. 
It uses the python requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to parse a webpage to obtain 
a list of download links for files relevant to analysis, then populates a specified 
directory by downloading these files. It then uses the .xlsx files downloaded to 
generate a .txt file in the form requested by the professor.
